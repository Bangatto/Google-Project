        <h2 class="main">About Me</h2>
        <p class="col-md-8 offset-2" style="margin-top:15px">A Committed Computer Science Student who enjoy learning new technologies everyday, as a new technologists, I have the drive and the passion to get the most out of programming. I`m passionate about studying people`s behaviour, technology and the development of a better society.</p>
        <p>I would like to eventually pursue a career in Cyber Security, I would love to protect people`s data. I`m fascinated by Human behaviour, how people make decisions, what motivate them and how they act in different scenarios.We think of technology: software and hardware, We tend not to think about the human side: the impact of this thing that weâ€™ve created and adopted as it permeates our lives. It impacts our cognition and our social interactions. This is the intersection between Computer Science and Psychology and I`m passionate about this.</p>
