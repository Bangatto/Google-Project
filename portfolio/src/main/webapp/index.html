        <h2 class="main">About Me</h2>
        <p class="col-md-8 offset-2" style="margin-top:15px">A Committed Computer Science Student who enjoy learning new technologies everyday, as a new technologists, I have the drive and the passion to get the most out of programming. I`m passionate about studying people`s behaviour, technology and the development of a better society.</p>
        <p>I would like to eventually pursue a career in Cyber Security, I would love to protect people`s data. I`m fascinated by Human behaviour, how people make decisions, what motivate them and how they act in different scenarios.We think of technology: software and hardware, We tend not to think about the human side: the impact of this thing that weâ€™ve created and adopted as it permeates our lives. It impacts our cognition and our social interactions. This is the intersection between Computer Science and Psychology and I`m passionate about this.</p>

        <h4> <i> *Google Software Product Sprint project </i> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a program designed by Google for new technologists who have passion and high potential to build incredible tools that can impact the tech community.</li>
            <li>Currently working alongside 3 students other accross North America collaboratively to design and build a custom web App. We are coached by a Google Engineer who help with Technical skills and provide career and academic mentorship.   </li>
            <li>We are using java web framenwork, HTML5 and CSS3 and through this I was able to build my personal portfolio and host it with the help from the Google Engineers.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h4> <i> *Travel Agency <i/> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I worked on this project in simulating an online travel agency using java by employing Arrays, class inheritance and objects.</li>
            <li>The online Travel system allows a Customer to book flights and make different hotel reservations depending on the availability of hotels using a basket where they can add funds to their accounts and use the fund to check out.</li>
            <li>The flight reservations and hotel reservations are placed in a customer basket with their prices indicated so that it allow the customer to book when the funds in his account exceed the price of his baskets.</li>

            <li>I wrote a program which can process and clean the data into a consistent state that can be analyzed and present it to the epidemiologists. I employed Numpy and  matlab to draw the graphs for further analysis.</li>
        </ul>
